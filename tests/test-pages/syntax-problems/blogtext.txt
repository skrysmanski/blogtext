Regarding shared connection vs. multiple connections:

* If you only have one thread, it doesn't matter (obviously).
* If you do primarily reading...
** ... and the thread count is <= the CPU (core) count: use multiple connections
** ... and you have more threads than CPUs (cores): use shared connection
* If you do primarily writing, use a shared connection.
* If you do about the same amount of reading and writing, use multiple connections.
