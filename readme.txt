BlogText is a plugin for WordPress that adds a simple wiki-like syntax to WordPress and enriches it with a
good Wordpress editor integration.

== Description ==
BlogText (http://blogtext.mayastudios.com) is a plugin for WordPress that allows you to use a simple wiki-like
syntax (based on the Creole wiki syntax) to write your posts and pages. This syntax is easy-to-learn and
fast-to-type. The goal behind BlogText is that you donâ€™t need to write HTML anymore to achieve the desired
text layout.

The following list lists some of the markups supported by BlogText. For a more complete list, see BlogText's
syntax description page at http://blogtext.mayastudios.com/syntax/ (which is written entirely in BlogText
syntax and demonstrates BlogText's capabilities).

Supported markup:

* Basic text formatting such as bold, italics, underlining, and strike-through
* Lists
* Tables
* Internal and external links
* Headings
* Table of contents
* Preformatted text and code blocks with syntax highlighting

BlogText also integrates into Wordpress' HTML editor by providing its own buttons (to create BlogText syntax),
media browser integration, and help links. This make writing posts with BlogText even easier.

== Changelog ==

= 0.9.2 =
* Checked compatibility against Wordpress 3.2
* Fixed problem where the id of an attachment could not be determined in some cases. In these cases the 
  attachment would not display correctly.
* Fix image info: Now also recognizes Exif JPEG images
* Fixed error when updating a page that doesn't use BlogText
* Added special (more natural) code block languages: C++, C++/Qt, C++/CLI, C#, Java (maps to java5)
* Added two new GeSHi themes with more complete coloring; the bright one is now the default one
* Added ability to highlight certain lines in code blocks
* The language lookup window can now be closed by pressing Escape or Return.
* Updated GeSHI to the most recent SVN revision
* Added some regression tests to avoid/reduce conversion errors when modifying BlogText's sources. (only in
  developer version obtained from BitBucket)

= 0.9.1.2 =
* Fixed RSS rendering

= 0.9.1.1 =
* The cache can now be cleared again from the admin bar
* Custom heading ids now work again (they were broken in 0.9.1)

= 0.9.1 =
* Absolute links (like `[[/feed|my feed]]`) can now be used.
* Fixed image captions for external images; they no longer have a width of 0px.
* Added "big" for image size which is just an alias for "large".
* Certain JPEG images (encoded with Progressive DCT) can now be used
* If an alt text is specified for an image, it's now used as title as well (if no title has been specified 
  separately). Previously the file name was chosen instead.
* Image titles will now be added as title attribute to the surround link, if there is any.
* Plain text URLs in lists are now correctly recognized
* Plain text URLs can now have a trailing fullstop, comma, semicolon, or colon without this being
  interpreted as part of the URL. Brackets still need to be "escaped" by a space.
* Added backticks for inline code snippets (as alternative to the `##` syntax).
* Slightly changed heading syntax. Now, an anchor id must be separated by a least one equal sign (`=`) from
  the heading text. This allows for hash signs in the headings text, eg. in "C# overview".
* The quote characters (`"`) around attributes for `{{{ ... }}}` code blocks are now optional.
* Added button to the editor (called "lang lookup") to lookup languages supported for syntax highlighting.
* The programming language can now also be specified by using the language's file extension. You can do this
  with ".c" for example.
* Rewrote output cache

= 0.9.0d =
* This version was just released to fix the buggy readme parser in the Wordpress Plugin Directory. It's
  identical to 0.9.0c.

= 0.9.0c =
* First official release.
